## Task
The purpose of this project is to clean the data set given to us, to graphically describe the relationship between the main parameters in the data, to see the size of the market and the number of downloads through the characteristics of the applications. These analytics help app developers predict how successful their apps will turn out to be. The conclusion of such analyzes can be useful for business owners and companies. They can evaluate how users perceive their products.

## Description
I did this project in 6 steps. They are Loading Dataset, Printing summarize dataset, Cleaning dataset Visualization, Correlations Matrix and Scatter Matrix. In this project I mainly tried to analyze the data visually. General conclusions: Developing successful mobile applications can be very beneficial for companies and countries. Based on the above analysis, it can be said that the most installed applications are games and family applications. Finance has the highest average price among app categories, followed by lifestyle, followed by medicine.
